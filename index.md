We try to make it better. You can help us too! How? By submitting your issues (if you have) or making pull requests!

## Prerequisites

Before installtion you need: `nginx` & `git`

If you don't have them try installing theme
(Exmaple for Ubuntu):

`$ sudo apt install nginx git`

If you want Pylocalhost to serve and render PHP files you will also need `php-fpm` Version 7.0 or higher(Exmaple for Ubuntu):

`$ sudo apt install php8.0 php8.0-fpm`

`$ sudo systemctl enable --now php8.0-fpm`

## Installation

Download `preinstaller.py` file from [here](https://github.com/mwxgaf/pylocalhost/releases/download/v1.5/preinstaller.py)

After that just run the file with **python 3**:

`$ python3 preinstaller.py`

In some OSs may be you must type `python` instead of `python3`

Then run the `installer.py` file(it will be created once you ran `preinstaller.py`) with **python 3** under **sudo**:

`$ sudo python3 installer.py`

It will show you details. If installation was unsuccessful please submit an issue including details and your system info.

*For installing Beta versin view the README.md in repository*

## Usage

Run:

`$ sudo pylh enable`

And then:

`$ sudo pylh start`

Then go to [http://localhost](http://localhost)

It will show you anything which is in `~/Pylocalhost` and always it will start automatically when you turn your computer on

Just this!

## Update

To be honest, the installer is uninstaller and insaller! So follow the installation process to update the software!

`$ sudo pylh restart`
